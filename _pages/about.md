I recently earned my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from National Taipei University of Technology, where I was an active member of the Energy Conversion and Integration Electronics (ECIE) Lab, advised by Prof. Yu-Chen Liu. My undergraduate journey combined rigorous research with extensive hands-on experience in high-frequency power electronics, culminating in our team winning Third Place in the 2024 IEEE International Future Energy Challenge (IFEC).

My research interests include high-frequency power converters, resonant converters, radio-frequency (RF) power amplifiers, magnetics design, machine learning, and digital control implementation. I am particularly interested in integrating these techniques to develop innovative RFâ€“power electronic converters.
